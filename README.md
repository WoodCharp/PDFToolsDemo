# PDF Tools Demo

Needed some simple way to create PDF files in my project witch lead to this.

* Grids, like in excel
* Automatically creates new pages
* Header and footer blocks
* Images

## Basic idea

Basic idea in this method is to add "blocks" which are total page width but user defined height.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54d4a790-3ecb-415a-8e82-c656a61603d6" width="400" />
